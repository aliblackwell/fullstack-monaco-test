# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?

#### Yarn (not technically a frontend library)
Yarn replaces npm as project package manager.

I started by attempting to fix the security vulnerabilities highlighted by `$ npm audit` in the branch `ali/security-fix`. I also encountered numerous missing peer dependencies and fixed these using `$ npm install [dependency] --save-dev`, but this had the unfortunate consequence of clogging up `package.json`. Noticing a Yarn lockfile as well as `package-lock.json`, I decided to investigate addressing the security vulnerabilities and missing peer dependencies using Yarn. 

After upgrading from Yarn 1.x to Yarn 3 following their [migration guidelines](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/migration#step-by-step), I found the experience of upgrading existing project dependencies using `$ yarn upgrade-interactive`(available after installing the interactive tools with `$ yarn plugin import interactive-tools`) to be very easy and fast. I was also taken by Yarn's 'Zero-Installs' approach, having read [Why you should check-in your node dependencies](https://www.jackfranklin.co.uk/blog/check-in-your-node-dependencies/) last year and agreeing with it all.

However, I spent a good couple of hours trying to get this working and ended up reverting to Yarn Classic and a node_modules folder. There are still 11 high and 1 critical vulnerabilities showing with `$ yarn audit`, but I have concluded that resolving them is beyond the scope of this test.



### Q) What's the command to start the application locally?

`yarn start`

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
